# Ubuntu Health API

## Overview

The Ubuntu Health API is a modern healthcare management system designed to address inefficiencies in traditional healthcare systems, particularly in South Africa. Many healthcare providers still rely on outdated systems, including pen-and-paper record-keeping, which leads to inefficiencies, errors, and delays in patient care. This API provides a robust, scalable, and secure solution to digitize healthcare operations, enabling better patient management, appointment scheduling, billing, and more.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare providers in South Africa often face challenges due to:

- **Manual Record-Keeping**: Paper-based systems are prone to errors, loss, and inefficiencies.
- **Fragmented Systems**: Lack of integration between patient records, billing, and appointment scheduling.
- **Limited Accessibility**: Difficulty in accessing patient data across multiple locations.
- **Role-Based Restrictions**: Inefficient management of staff roles and permissions.

The Ubuntu Health API aims to solve these problems by providing a centralized, digital platform for managing healthcare operations.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication & Role Management

- Secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Role-based access control for Admin, Doctor, Nurse, and Receptionist roles.
- Tenant-based isolation to ensure data privacy for multi-tenant environments.

### 2. Patient Management

- CRUD operations for managing patient records.
- Tenant-specific patient data to ensure data isolation.
- Support for storing detailed patient information, including medical history, allergies, and emergency contacts.

### 3. Appointment Scheduling

- Manage appointments for patients with support for different appointment types.
- Role-based access to appointment data.
- Conflict detection to prevent double-booking.

### 4. Prescription Handling

- Manage prescriptions for patients, including medications, dosages, and refill information.
- Role-based access for doctors to create and update prescriptions.

### 5. Billing

- Generate and manage invoices for patient appointments and treatments.
- Track payment statuses and add notes for billing records.

### 6. Clinical Notes

- Allow doctors to add and manage clinical notes for patients.
- Secure storage of sensitive medical information.
